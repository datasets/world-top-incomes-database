As a rule they were estimated from the top 0.1% share within the top 1% share: a=1/[1-log(S1%/S0.1%)/log(10)]. When the top 0.1% and top 1% shares were not available, the closest substitutes were used.",The inverted Pareto-Lorenz b coefficients were computed from the Pareto-Lorenz coefficients using the formula b=a/(a-1). Alternatively they can be computed by using directly the top income shares series and the formula: b=1/[log(S1%/S0.1%)/log(10)].
